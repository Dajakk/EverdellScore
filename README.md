# EverdellScore
Serverless JS App for counting Everdell Score.

## Content
As the summing up the total points of a game of Everdell can be complex, this application should help players to identify the winner of the game faster.
It allows you to choose all the cards per player and will give the sum up the total points per player. Special effects of prosperity cards are determined automatically, while for some Special Event cards a manual input must be done.
The application also prevents that cards are multiple chosen, if not allowed (e.g. unique cards or number of cards).
